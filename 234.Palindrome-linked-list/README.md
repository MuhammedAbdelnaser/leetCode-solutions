# Palindrome Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to determine whether the linked list is a palindrome or not.

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

## Examples

### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list forms a palindrome: 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1.
```

### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: head = [1, 2]
Output: false
Explanation: The linked list does not form a palindrome: 1 -> 2.
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
